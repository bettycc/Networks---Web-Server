Betty Chen, Chuanxi Xiong

1. This project includes 4 java fils(HTTPResponse.java, SecureWebServer.java, WebServer.java, Main.java), a Makefile, a ReadMe.txt, a server.jks, server.cer, and cacerts.jks.

2. To run the server, open terminal and go into the directory where all the java files and the makefile is located, and use make file by typing "make" to compile, and then type “java Main —serverPort=##### —sslSecurePort=#####” to run the project.

3. We run the project2_autograder.py script on UChicago's linux system, and all the test cases are passed.
